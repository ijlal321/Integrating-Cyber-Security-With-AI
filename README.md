# Integrating Cyber Security With AI

Welcome to the "Integrating Cyber Security With AI" repository! This repository showcases a collection of projects that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with cybersecurity to enhance threat detection and protection. While we have many projects in this repository, the main projects are highlighted below:

## Main Projects

### AI For Malware Detection
This project focuses on using machine learning algorithms to detect and classify malware based on behavioral patterns and code analysis. It utilizes a dataset of malware samples to train and deploy a robust malware detection system.

### Building A Phishing Detection System With AI
In this project, we leverage AI techniques to detect phishing attempts in emails and web content. The system employs machine learning models trained on phishing indicators to identify and flag potential phishing attacks, enhancing cybersecurity defenses against social engineering threats.

### Building An Email Filtering System With AI
This project involves developing an AI-powered email filtering system to differentiate between legitimate emails (ham) and spam emails. Using machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), the system learns to classify incoming emails accurately, improving email security and user experience.

## More Projects Coming Soon
We are continuously working on new projects to expand our cybersecurity portfolio. Stay tuned for upcoming projects covering a wide range of cybersecurity with AI topics.
